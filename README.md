### Five features of my project

- My web page is built with React Router DOM. That is why it is possible to navigate multiple routes on a single page on my website without any reload.

- I used the Tailwind CSS framework instead of vanilla CSS for my web pages, which allowed me to do all my design-related tasks without any problems. As a result I have been able to give many attractive designs to my web page. And  I have made my website responsive for all types of devices, so my website will look good on all devices.

- My website is an e-commerce website. I have six brands of products on my website. Among the brands are Samsung Sony Apple Google Xiaomi and Asus. And every brand has many types of products starting from mobiles and more.

- And to know the details of each product of each brand, a user must login to the website.

- To get access to private routes on my website you must login so I have two options for login firstly login with password and email. And there is an option to login with google account.
